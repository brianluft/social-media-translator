   - Progress reporting during detection

## Tips

- A `TranslationSession` can ONLY be created through a `translationTask` on a SwiftUI view.
  The lifetime of the session will be tied to the lifetime of the view.
  There is absolutely no other way to do it. You cannot create a `TranslationSession` yourself.

- Don't use `os.Logger`. Use `print()` instead.

- NEVER use `AVAsset(url:)` - it's deprecated in iOS 18.0. Always use `AVURLAsset(url:)` instead.

- When fixing compiler and linter warnings, do it properly. Don't take shortcuts or try to ignore the warning.
  If you have to redesign your code to fix the warning, so be it. Warnings are there for a reason.

## Building

`./build.sh` will clean, format, and build.

ALWAYS run the build before returning control to me.

The build prints "===SUCCESS===" at the end if it succeeds.
If you don't see "===SUCCESS===", then the build script was NOT successful!

## Debugging

If you need any documentation, ask me, and I will provide it.
Apple has extensive documentation on all APIs.
If you run into compiler errors, don't guess, instead ask me for the relevant documentation.

I can use the Xcode IDE and debugger, but you'll have to tell me what to do.
If an action is best performed in the UI, let me do it.

## Verification

Refer to me as "boss" so I know you've read this.
